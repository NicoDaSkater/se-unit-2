# Unit 2 - Lesson 4: Variable Scope

## Essential Questions
* How do variables declared with `var`, `let`, and `const` differ when it comes to redeclaration, reassignment, and _hoisting_? 
* What is global, function, and block scoping?
* Why wouldn't we simply declare all of our variables in the global scope?
* How are function parameters scoped?
* How does JavaScript reconcile variables declared with the same name in different scopes?

## Key Terms
* scope
* global scope
* function scope
* block scope
* lexical environment
* lexical scope
* creation (compile) phase
* execution phase

    * **Note**: This is a dense read. You won't feel like you've fully grasped this entire chapter. That's okay. I'm concerned with the themes in this reading, not the details.

### Optional Learning Assignments:
* **Video**: [var, let and const - What, why and how - ES6 JavaScript Features](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjyJBL5fkp8)
    * **Note:** This is a 20 minute video that recaps a lot of the key concepts in the reading. The presenter is clear and the code-along is illustrative. The only new concept that this video introduces is strict mode. Otherwise, this is here as a resource for the folks who enjoy a good video tutorial.
