# Javascript Data Control Flow

## Conditionals

You're a bouncer at a bar. Given an `age` variable, create a conditional that satisfies the following requirements...
* If a patron is older than `21`, print out `"Come on in!"`.
* If a patron is between `18` and `21`, print out `"Come on in (but no drinking)!"`.
* If a patron is younger than 18, print out `"You're too young to be in here!"`.
* If a patron is older than 75, print out `"Are you sure you want to be here?"`.

```js
// Your answer goes here.
```

#### Bonus

Bar patrons must have an ID if the bouncer is even going to consider what age they are.
- If the patron has an ID, the bouncer will then check if they are of the proper age
- If the patron does not have an ID, the bouncer will tell them `"No ID, no entry."`

> Hint: Whether the patron has an ID or not can be stored in a `hasId` variable. What do you think the stored data type should be?

## Loops

Your task is to create a loop that prints out all the odd numbers between 1 and 100...twice! Your solution must use one `for` loop and one `while` loop.

```js
// Your answer goes here.
```

#### Bonus

* Try doing this using a single `for` loop
* Make it so that the first iteration of the loop prints out all odd numbers between 1 and 100 but the second iteration of the loop prints out all of the even numbers between 1 and 100

## Bonus: Fizz-Buzz

Fizz-Buzz is a classic coding exercise that you can create using your knowledge of conditionals and loops. Implement code that does the following...
* Counts from 1 to 100 and prints out something for each number.
* If the number is divisible by 3, print `"Fizz"`.
* If the number is divisible by 5, print `"Buzz"`.
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print `"FizzBuzz"`.
* If the number does not meet any of the above conditions, just print the number.

Your output should look something like this...

```text
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...
```

```js
// Your answer goes here.
```

#### Bonus (for the bonus)

* Encapsulate all of your logic into a function, so that each iteration of the game will trigger function calls that look something like these...

```js
fizzBuzz(1)
// => prints "1" to the console

fizzBuzz(3)
// => prints "3" to the console

fizzBuzz(15)
// => prints "FizzBuzz" to the console
```
