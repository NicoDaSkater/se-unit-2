# Unit 2 - Lesson 2: Variables, Control Flow, and Iterators

## Essential Questions
* What is the difference between variables declared with `let`, `const`, and `var`?
* What does it mean for a variable to be _block scoped_?
* Why might it be helpful to think of a variable as a _binding_?
* When would we declare a variable with `let` vs. `const`?
* What does control flow mean?
* What two keywords can we use to interrupt iteration?
* How do `while` loops, `do...while`, and `for` loops differ? What do they have in common?

## Vocabulary

* iterate
* scope
